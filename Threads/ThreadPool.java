//Behaviour of Executor Framework
/*An Executor is an object that is responsible for threads management and execution of Runnable tasks submitted from the client code. It decouples the details of thread creation, scheduling, etc from the task submission so you can focus on developing the taskâ€™s business logic without caring about the thread management details.*/
